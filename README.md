# About
Slight modification of @AlanTheBenign's stronghold finder to read directly from the clipboard. Also reads nether coords. All cases are meant for speedrunning. Any questions or concerns about the algorithm of the stronghold finder should be directed toward https://github.com/AlantheBenign/Minecraft-Stronghold-Finder.

# Installation
1. Install the latest version of python at https://www.python.org/downloads/
> If you installed the latest version of python, skip this step. To number 3.

2. Next would be to download/clone this repository. Whichever option you take, make sure to note the directory of where you download/clone the repository to; this will come in handy later.

3. Next we have to install pip. If you have Python 2 >=2.7.9 or Python 3 >=3.4 versions, pip should already be installed on your machine. To double check, you can always open a command line/terminal on your PC and type "pip". If you see "'pip' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file," then it's not installed. You can follow installation instructions from https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

4. Now that we have pip, it's time to install the dependent modules for the project. We have to open up a command line (terminal if on mac). The easiest way to do this is to go to the folder where we downloaded/cloned the project before. 
> For windows: Once in the root folder, simply type "CMD" in the address bar near the top of the window, and it should open a command line in the correct directory.

> For mac: Make sure the terminal icon is on your icon dock "bottom of screen". Next, simply drag the root folder onto that icon and your done.

5. We are almost done! Next, simply type in the command: pip install -r requirements.txt . This will install all necessary dependencies for the project.

6. Once that is done, we can finally run the script. Simply type in the command line: python main.py

### That's it! You are now successfully using my version of the stronghold finder that directly reads from the clipboard so you don't have to type coordinates yourself during a run! :)
