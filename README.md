Slight modification of AlanTheBenign's stronghold finder to read directly from the clipboard. Also reads nether coords. All cases are meant for speedrunning. Any questions or concerns about usage of the stronghold finder itself should be directed toward https://github.com/AlantheBenign/Minecraft-Stronghold-Finder.
